# Extended Euclidean Algorithms Step By Step Working Generator

Simple side-project for generating each step in extended euclidean algorithm 
since doing the algorithm by hand is quite repetitive.

How to use:  
 
1. Run the program main.exe
2. Insert the two number for the algorithm to run
3. It will run Euclidean Algorithm to check its final remainder 
4. If the remainder is 1 then it will automatically run the Extended Euclid algorithm
